### Shop Notifications

This tool will send chat notifications to Slack after completion of any commands you specify!
Unfortunately, due to limitations of bash/sudo, I think, if the command is run with "sudo", it will not work.
To run a command as root, either add "sudo" to the function in bashrc, or run command with <su -c "command -f">


1. EDIT CONFIG.SH
2. RUN INSTALL.SH
3. RUN su -c "your-command -w -t -f derp"
4. RECIEVE CHAT MESSAGE FROM BOT WHEN IT FINISHES.
